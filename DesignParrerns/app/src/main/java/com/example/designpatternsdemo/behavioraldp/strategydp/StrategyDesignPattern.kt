/**
 * The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms,
 * encapsulates each algorithms into a separate class, and makes them interchangeable,
 * allowing the algorithm to vary independently of the client that uses it.
 *
 * It provides flexibility by letting clients select and switch between different algorithms at runtime
 * without altering existing code, enhancing code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility
 */

/**
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strategy-pattern-set-1/
 *
 * To sort input data, we can have different strategy/algo
 * like Quick sort, merge sort, selection sort, bubble sort etc.
 *
 * Based on the need we can choose and set required strategy to apply.
